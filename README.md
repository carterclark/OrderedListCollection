# OrderedListCollection

This is an ordered list of type TechJob, with three parameters: name of job, projected growth rate, and average salary.
The list is sorted alphabetialy in descending order but implements an iterator to list the TechJobs alphabetically in ascending order

This was a class project and I wanted to do something that would help me narrow down what the best jobs in tech would be.
